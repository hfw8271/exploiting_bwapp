In this direcory you will find the scripts I used to exploit the sql injection vulnerability in bwapp using blind time based tools. This injection is preformed using sqlmap, which is used as a tool for sql injection, sqlmap makes use of prompting the database with numerous questions and introducing a time delay to check server response. sqlmap can be used to enumerate databe about the database, and used to obtain the information in the database.

To first use this tool as I have it written, use sqlInjectionBlindTime_getDatabases.sh on the bWAPP server to obtain the names of its databases hosted in mySQL. the output will look like the image labled sqlInjectBlindTime_databases.jpg, showing the database bWAPP, which will be exploited further. using "sqlInjectBlind time_getTables.sh bWAPP" will output all tables in the bWAPP databse and can be seen in the jpg sqlInjectBlindTime_bWAPPtables.jpg. Each table is then used with the script "sqlInjuectBlindTime_getColumns.sh $TABLE" to obtain the columns of each table, which can be seen in the jpgs labled sqlInjectBlindTime_bWAPP(TABLENAME)Column.jpg. Now that the entire database has been mapped I use the script "sqlInjectBNlindTime_dump.sh bWAPP" to obtain all information in each table of the bWAPP database, which can be seen in the jpgs sqlInjectBlindTime_bWAPP(TABLENAME)Drop.jpg.
