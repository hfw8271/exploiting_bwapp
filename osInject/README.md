In this direcory you will find the script I used to exploit the os injection vulnerability in bwapp. 

The first step is to set up a listener using netcat, this can be done with the "reverseShell.sh" script. This is not necissary to exploit the command but I find it easier to read the output in my command prompt then in the html. 

The os injection is vulnerable due to un sanitized input from the web server, allowing attackers to esacpe the input with a semicolon, and execute bash code as if they were on the machine.

I am working on a script to allow this process to be done outside of the web GUI but it is not completed.
