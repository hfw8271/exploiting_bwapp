In this direcory you will find the script I used to exploit the sql injection vulnerability in bwapp. This injection is preformed using the HTTP POST method.

The following describes how to use the script and how it works. 
 
USE:

In order to exploit this vulnerability you must first read the meain README for this project to set up bwapp.

To use this script ensure that you are in the directory that the script is in, otherwise it will not work. 

Now all you must to is execute the script. And your output will be the html returned by the server after it is exploited.

 HOW IT WORKS:

 SLQ injection is possible when inputs are not sanitized. Allowing users to input code into a text input. The following text is used " ' or 1=1; --  ", the single quote is used as an escape to the input box, allowing sql code to be input after. the code being 'or 1=1' is injected which tells the script that based on the input given or 1=1, what to return. The input that is expected is used in a sql where clause, assuming the statesment is "SELECT * FROM {TABLE} WHERE {INPUT}", since the input is now '' or 1=1, the where clause will be true for all columns in the database. the '-- ' injection is a mysql comment, which is used to tell the database that everything after the 1=1 is a comment and will not be executed, this prevents any other clauses in the sql code to be ignored and will execute "SELECT * FROM {TABLE} WHERE '' or 1=1"

The script first called ../bwappLogin.php, this is to login to the bwapp webserver and get the session cookie. 

The script uses this exploit in the POST request, using this exploit generates the following POST data "title=%27+or+1%3D1%3B+--+&action=search" thus this is used in the script. The POST data contains the exploit and payload that are delivered to the web server.

 Output of this exploit from the bwapp gui can be seen at sqlInjectPost_explt.JPG, and the output from the script can be seen at sqlInjectPost_out.txt. The gui has a user friendly view of the exploit being used, whereas the script shows the return from the server, and the tables obtained from the sql database will be found in this html output.

 NOTE: the script currently does not work, Im trying to fix it. I think it has to do with the payload because as you can see from its output I get a HTTP 200 response, but the exfiltraed SQL data is not in the response.
